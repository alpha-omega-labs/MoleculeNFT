# Conclusion:

GenesisL1 blockchain first time ever stored molecular structure file entirely on chain on block height 2725805:
103D THE UNUSUAL STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN CENTROMERE (GGA)2 MOTIF: UNPAIRED GUANOSINE RESIDUES STACKED BETWEEN SHEARED G(DOT)A PAIRS

txid: 0xa49427f22a3441e3e4a8944496c826cfacec27067ced4eb16f268298412abf30
Cumulative Gas Used 19,616,081

GenesisL1 blockchain is capable to store molecular structures entirely on blockchain, comparatively high GenesisL1block gas limit (100M) should be significantly raised to fit all large structures e.g. 100M to 10B
